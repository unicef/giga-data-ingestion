                world's largest, most comprehensive database of schools mapped
                around the world. It relies on collaboration and data
                contributions from a number of sources, such as Governments,
                Internet Service Providers (ISPs), Ministries of Education and
                private companies. As such, your contributions are highly valued
                and essential to us achieving our mission of connecting every
                school to the internet by 2030.
