# Giga DataOps Platform: Giga Sync

The objective of the platform is to ingest school data
from various sources, applying concepts from master data management and data governance
in order to produce a single source of truth—the **School Master Data**—which will then
be used by consumers and downstream applications.

This repository contains the code for **Giga Sync**, the data ingestion portal for the
Platform.
